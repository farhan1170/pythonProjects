Movie is an good attempt in bringing out nuances of Charles Sobhraj saga. Though story details are sketchy but the performances of Randeep and Richa are first rate.

Indian filmmakers should learn from this and look to biopics more often. They'll get quality material for their films and the audiences will get engaging tales on characters that are a lot more believable and layered. Prawaal Raman certainly made the best film of his life trailing the exploits of Charles Sobhraj in India. He's got Randeep Hooda to thank in big measure because the actor relives Sobhraj in a power packed performance. I would recommend this,movie

I somehow suspended logic and got lost in the imaginary world that unveiled in front of me. Audience around me seemed equally spell bound. The cliffhanger finish was a terrible pause, until I realized it was the end and I really had to wait another full year to see what happens next.

outstanding indian movie,movie
good movie with awsome graphics,movie
Excellent Visual effects....,movie
Director Rajamouli's magnum opus Baahubali is the excellent reply to Hollywood movies like Troy & 300. Script is based on epic saga of Mahabharat : Good vs Evil. Movie has high dose of Visual effects e.g. water fall and battle scene which will give you feel of world class cinema. Turning warrior Tamannah to Angel by natural make up was brilliant sequence. Prabhas and Rana have given outstanding performance. Tamannaah will surprise you with her action sequences. Ramya and Anushka were brilliant in small role. Music was not up to the standard.,movie
"""I watched the movie and i give 3.5 Rating because this is just the Beginning Part, Story and Direction is good, Music also very good like a Indian Tradition music mostly in the movie. and Visual Effects are superb just like Hollywood movies. But in the Climax Scenes Remind me Lord of the Rings and The Hobbits, so still the Tollywood and Bollywood Copycats. But Good Movie.""",movie

"""I have watched original Telugu version of Bahubali and instantly liked it. Hollywood style of picturization, VFX effects are all one side of the picture. But there is another side. Previously the maximum amount of budget for Telugu movies used to be just around Rs.70 crores. But all of a sudden, now Bahubali raised it to Rs.250 crores. Small movies and their makers in Telugu are already suffering a lot because of such big budget films. They don't get even enough number of cinema halls to release their make. Added to this, Super stars like Mahesh Babu, Prabhas and Rana charge anywhere between 15 - 25 crores per movie. When half of the budget goes to the hero and director, how can one produce a movie?""",movie

One of the best direction of Indian film industry. Full entertaining movie.,movie
Eagerly Waiting for the second part.......,movie
"""really Fantastic, especially cinematography.""",movie
great biopic.........,movie
"""Outstanding Great ,competitor to hollywood.""",movie
"""Touted as one of the most expensive films to be made in India, this highly anticipated part one of the two-part period epic, manages to enthrall you with its sheer scale and grandeur. Painstakingly made, paying acute attention to detail for the minutest of sound and visuals, Rajamouli (Eega, Magadheera) , who spent three years making this ambitious film ensures that the larger-than-life execution matches his grandiose vision. Though this swashbuckling adventure relies heavily on CGI and VFX, it doesn't lack emotional resonance. It manages to be much more than a blood-soaked romp. The heart of the film lies in the simple thought that good is mightier than evil.""",movie
It reveals the new era of Indian Cinema.,movie
Bahubali i went just because of so many feedback ..but really movie was not that like Super 5...,movie
why u made incomplete movie and katappa ne bahubali ko q mara,movie
"""When I came out of theatre I felt a sense of pride that if given an opportunity with flexible budget, we have directors like S.S. Rajamouli who can visualize a dream and put it on the plate which will tempt you to say bravo. Whenever someone praises a Hollywood film I appreciate but I never like the same when it is compared to our Bollywood saying Indian cinema can never attempt to be at par with its competitor. Mind my words, Indian cinema has evolved over the years and has been successful in raising the bar be its Shankar's I or Robot.""",movie
"""Touted as the most expensive Indian film till date, Bahubali will not disappoint you. You can feel every penny of 280 crores spent on this humongous project, sheer hard work of the team and director's vision can be perceived. The waterfall, the empire that is shown on a grand scale is something you have never seen before in Indian cinema. This is a work of fiction which is not a remake of Mahabharata but a type of epic in itself. A small boy guarded by Ramaiya similar to Vasu Dev bringing Krishna through the Yamuna waters, is saved by a tribe who in search of his identity meets with his real personification. Anuska shetty plays the mother of this boy who is bahubali. Her character reminds you of Rakhi in Karan Arjun.Rana Dagubatti is the antagonist. Tamanna plays the love interest of Prabhas. The first 30 minutes establishes the characters but after that it becomes an engaging affair. My favourite pick-ups are the scenes where Prabhas carry the shivling on his shoulders so that her mother don't have to walk long for performing abhishek, when he make Tamanna realize that she is a girl behind her rebellious act, when Prabhas kills the son of Rana Dagubatti, the erection of statue and last but not the least the 30 minutes battle which is a big achievement in itself. It's a two part movie like Gangs Of Wasseypur Rakta Charitra spread over 290 minutes. The second part will release in early 2016, but you will get the glimpse of the same in the finale which will leave you gasping for some more.""",movie
"""Going by the rave reviews, strong word of mouth and first day collections which is ever highest 90 crores worldwide, the movie will be known as blockbuster at present but over the years it will be remembered as a classic. A spectacular epic that is sure to leave the audience in anticipation of the second part. My personal request to everyone who is looking forward to this movie this weekend, please catch the flick in your nearby cinema as watching in mobile is hazardous and loose the essence of vfx/CGI that is at par with Hollywood biggies.""",movie
"""So India can do a LOTR too....:) :)...and a sequel at that. Nothing beats the entertainment based on ancient history types, the kings and queens, with their evil commander in chiefs and loyal ministers, with sufficient intrigue and fairy tale like plots....oh man, talk about entertainment, and Baahubali has scored well.

a great grandeur movie depicting history is a rarity in indian cinema,movie
"""there are a few glitches, which may not be deal-breakers per say but do stick out. For instance, Tamannaah, who plays the Katniss Everdeen like bow-wielding warrior, breaks into a romantic song with Shiva, baring her slender midriff to cater to 'popular demands'. Shiva's impromptu dance under the waterfall is reminiscent of a Liril commercial. The film's duration could be an issue for those not high on patience. Also, the movie reminds you of Troy, Thor, The Dark Knight Rises, Karan Arjun (Devasena chanting, 'Mera beta aayega') to name a few, giving you the recurring 'been-there-seen-that' feeling. Shiva has the values of Prince Hector, bravery of Achilles and can make the jump Bruce Wayne did to get out of the pit. Bhallala deva can be Agamemnon.""",movie
"""However, the elaborate battle-scene climax makes the film a spectacular watch nonetheless. Very rarely has an Indian film managed to achieve this feat. The casting is terrific. Ramya Krishnan in her short but substantial role is flawless as the feisty Raajmata. Tamannaah does the action bit well. Prabhas and Rana Daggubati are outstanding. They hugely contribute to making this routine good vs bad film a visual extravaganza...entertainment guaranteed. The scene which sees Shiva singlehandedly erecting a giant gold statue of Bhallala Deva is jawdroppingly iconic. Take a bow S.S. Rajamouli.""",movie

In one scene, we have Praveen, a proud Hindu who does everything possible to look the younger version of Salman Khan, tastes meat accidentally and likes it very much. Similarly, Hafiz gets drunk one day in the excitement of meeting Rosanna (Jacqueline Fernandez), but says it was the best day of his life. Though it seems like a stereotyped notion of being cool that the Hindi film industry has been propagating since long that liquor and free-spirited young women are the necessary thrusts to salvation.

"""s for the performances, it is Kunal Khemu who leads the way in the film. The irony of the film is that despite Kunal Khemu not having a double role, he portrays two roles in the film. One cannot take away the fact that he has put in a sincere and an honest performance in the film. There is hardly anything that even he could have done in the film which had a senseless plot. As for the heroines, despite Mandana Karimi 'playing' the second lead (or is it parallel lead?), the film sees her in an extended cameo. Whereas the full film is being dominated by the likes of Manasi Scott and Zoa Morani. While Manasi Scott delivers what was expected of her role, Zoa Morani gets stuck with a solo expression in the film throughout. She definitely has miles to go as far as acting is concerned. The most shocking element was the cameo appearance of Vikram Bhatt, whose character of 'jin' is so gimmicky that it lands up invoking laughter rather than any kind of mystic feelings. Mukul Dev in the role of a pony tailed ACP is totally wasted. The rest of the actors do no good to the lacklustre film.""",movie

If u have watched 'Warriors' then please don't go to watch 'Brothers' with the same mindset. Yes it is an official remake but this is a completely new story written over the basic theme of 'Warriors'. They have tried to provide more insight in the lives of the main protagonists. There is more emotional quotient then the original and I will agree that it has gone little over the line at some points to weaken the impact. But you should go for it and watch for the splendid acting of Akshay and Jackie well supported by Siddharth and Jacqueline.,movie

"""The review is third class as well. Here is proper review. No complaints about performances but the director was clueless. Even while making a remake when the director doesn't know when to play music and when to let the action speak, we know that most bollywood directors are talent-less.""",movie
"""A) Music when not required: When a fight starts, we want the sound of punches and reaction of the crowd. Not the boom boom boom boom beats. All the fights have stupid fast music throughout.""",movie
"""B) Director is clueless of what to show when the fight starts! Here you go the bell rings, both fighters step closer about to throw the punches....and we cut to Jacky Shroff jumping on his chair... Wow. Way to kill the excitement. Left me frustrated like the cable went dead just before last ball of the match India vs Pakistan.""",movie
"""C) It is in fact a continuation of B. When the scene is back to the octagon, the fighters have already skipped to another level of fight. EG, there was a scene where Akshay had locked a submission, we cut to a reaction scene, back to the fight and he's exchanging punches with his opponent. I mean whatever happened to the submission??""",game
The movie could have been fantastic if directed by a class Director. Not everyone can be Rajmouli. But then Rajamouli would create a spectacle better than any holywood fight scene.,movie

"""After churning out blockbusters in the last few days, Bollywood had all the hopes with the Independence week release brothers to continue the momentum. The movie did not opened to rave reviews but the strong buzz that generated from the first trailer that released on 10th June and positive word of mouth helped the movie to take a record breaking opening for the lead actors. Not only at the Indian box office but the overseas box office news was very overwhelming. The trailer of brothers is the most watched and it crossed 8 million views in recod time. Many of the critics opined that the first half is too sluggish and melodramatic as compared to the original Hollywood movie Warrior which is superior to Hindi version. I agree that no one could match up to the original work whether it's Sholay or Zanzeer but Karan Malhotra has done a fantastic job in casting the right actors, making them trained for 6 months for MMA, action that is never seen before on this silver screen, and finally offering a product that Indian audience can relate and accept that is relationship/ bonding. In the first half he has build the foundation and the second half succeeds in keeping the promise.""",movie
The story is about 2 estranged brothers whose family is split apart by an accident and the bad habits of Jackie and how the circumstances bring them in the R2F that is right to fight championship and faceoff each other in the finals.,movie
"""The premise is strong and the reason for fight is justified. There are only 4 songs that doesn't hamper the pace of the movie. The lead actors are incredible supported well by Jacqueline, Jackie, Shefali, Ashutosh, Kiran Kumar. Finally, the team of Agneepath is back with another remake that has all the masala to rule the box office till another Movie Phantom hits on 28th of this month.""",movie

"""It’s clear why Karan Johar wanted to remake the film, given how it’s basically a Bollywood film at heart. But it’s surprising how little has been done with such a great premise. Despite being set in contemporary times, the films feels like a 90s pot-boiler, with an over-the-top Jackie Shroff, Kiran Kumar playing a businessman named Peter Bregenza, Shefali Shah in a role where she’s expected to cry throughout, and Akshay Kumar whose ‘action’ speaks louder than words. There’s even Raj Zutshi hamming it up as a commentator.""",movie
"""as far as i know this is copy of Warrior (2011) hollywood movie. Indian directors have lost their mind they don't have idea's and stories to write anymore. so all in all this is not good enough. Brothers is a waste movie. Please do not waste your money in this stupid movie. I think how the genius Karan Johar remade such a movie. Karan why do not you remake movie like Taken, Transporter or some Malayalam movies like Mumbai Police or Kamal’s Raghavan? Something like the edge of the seat thriller. The movie has no interesting story and the first half is slow & boring and the second half is just wrestling. You can better enjoy WWE rather this movie. Dharma Productions which presents the Blockbuster Bahubali now presents Brothers. What a downfall?

Yahoo review & TOI's review tottally different! :)),movie
"""Watching Karan Malhotra’s ‘Brothers’ is like déjà vu. It’s like re-watching the worst of the ‘70s – this film is as cliché-ridden as it can be. It has it all - a drunken father jailed for killing his wife, sparring stepbrothers, token Muslim characters.""",movie
"""Not only is this a shoddy remake (of Gavin O’Connor’s ‘Warriors’), it also brandishes the most pedestrian dialogues that you would have heard in any recent Hindi film. Fat droplets of melodrama ooze out from every bit of the narrative. Right from the first scene, where we see a 1970s-like release from jail, the film is wrought in stereotypes, in a way that even contemporary Bollywood forsaken. But wait, remember Karan Malhotra’s last outing - the remake of ‘Agneepath’? Well, that too was as formulaic as it could get.""",movie
"""Such was the ordeal of sitting through the film, I was tempted to walk out at the interval. But I didn’t. And so I have this tale to tell: You can give ‘Brothers’ a complete miss, and you wouldn’t have missed anything at all.""",movie

"""Actually if you look on Wikipedia, I think you'll find that Turn up the music was released in February 2012, 10 months prior to this song (which is a blatant copy). This song, whilst catchy, is a complete copy of another artist's music; which I believe is so disrespectful. Chris Brown has put in hard work in making his song, and it's not fair for anyone to just copy it, come up with your own damn music. If Chris brown were to know, he would probably sue. """,movie

Get rid of the stamina and auto battle... 1/5 stars compared to zenonia 5 Get rid of the auto battle quest garbage. Also remove the stamina nonsense every game coming out keeps adding this annoying feature that limits players ability to immerse themselves in what could be great games. 1/5 compared to zenonia 5. Also in order to promote a huge player base be sure to advertise the game during sporting events like clash of clans did. Their player base sky rocketed to over 100 millions players.,movie
What happened What happened to this game all the other were so good. And now it's just played mission by mission. There is nothing good about this game just another boring half-assed game. You know the others stood out do to the ability to just free Rome and do the game how you wanted. But now that is gone and so had my interest in this wance grate phone game series.,movie
It's OK so far I enjoy how simplistic gameplay is and its good for killing time. I also love how easy it is to level up and that I don't have to pay to do so like I would in some other similar games. That said I have noticed some bugs while playing on my ZTE Whirl. The main issue being the force closure that happens every couple minutes and freezing then crash when I go to complete missions. Aside from those I noticed some minor stalling and lag during autoplay.,movie
Interesting Looks different and play is reminiscent of other games of the genre. Only lvl 5 and already being asked to rate. Will rate again after playing a bit.,movie

Rinjin can only be fluked The AI automatically fascilitates the entire game to make you lose. By mixing his fruit with yours.
